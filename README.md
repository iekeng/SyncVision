## WebRTC Video Conferencing App

The WebRTC Video Conferencing App (syncvision) is a real-time video and audio conferencing application built using WebRTC, Flask, and Socket.IO. It allows users to create and join virtual meeting rooms for online video conferencing.

### Features

- Create and join video conference rooms.
- Real-time audio and video streaming.
- Text chat functionality within the conference.
- Screen sharing capabilities (in-development).
- Mute/unmute audio and video during the conference.
- Responsive design for both desktop and mobile devices.

### Technologies Used

- **WebRTC**: Enables real-time audio and video communication directly in web browsers.
- **Websockets**: Enables bidirectional communication between clients and the server.
- **Socket.IO**: Provides real-time communication between the server and clients.
- **Flask**: A Python web framework used for building the backend signalling server.
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: Frontend development.
- **Open-relay**: A third party STUN/TURN server used.
- **Redis**: Used to cache meeting and users session data for effective session management.
- **Heroku**: Deployment platform for the application.
